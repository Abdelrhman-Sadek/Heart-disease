# Heart-disease
this is a machine_learing model that predicts heart disease depending on stats like cholesterol levels,age,MaxHR,etc
in this model I frist did some preprocessing and fixing outliners then I used Random Forest Classifier(tree ensemble) to predict whether the subject hava a heart disease or not 
the accuracy of this model is 88.5%
